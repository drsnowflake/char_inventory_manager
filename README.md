### Character Inventory Manager

A Dungeon Master (DM) has approached asking for a way to monitor and modify their players inventory due to constantly losing the paper character sheets.

#### MVP

- The app should allow the user to create new characters
- The app should allow the user to create new items
- The app should allow the user to assign/remove items from characters
- The app should allow the user to edit and delete characters/items

#### Possible Extensions

- The app could allow the ability to add further races and classes for creation
- The user could not be able to assign more than 10 items to a character
- The app could not only have a page showing all characters/items but also the ability to see items equipped to a particular character
- Each instance of a character could have a designated wearable inventory
- The app could restrict certain items (eg helmets/gloves) to specific slots (eg head/hands) in the character inventory
- Tracking of character health/stats
- Any further features relevant to character/inventory management
